# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018 (Linear Models in R - Tutorial 1)

**Today's Progress**: Traveling, so learning statistics tests in R. Today it was Linear Models.

**Thoughts:** Using Jupyter notebooks for R makes life easier. Though I have to learn how to plot better graphics.

**Link to work:** No link so far.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018 (Mixed Linear Models in R - Tutorial 2)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Tutorial 2 for Mixed Linear Models. Started learning the concepts and did some coding. Have to finish it later.

**Thoughts**: The coding is quite straight forward. I feel that a course in R is going to be helpful.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
