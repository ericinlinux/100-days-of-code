# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018 (Linear Models in R - Tutorial 1)

**Today's Progress**: Traveling, so learning statistics tests in R. Today it was Linear Models.

**Thoughts:** Using Jupyter notebooks for R makes life easier. Though I have to learn how to plot better graphics.

**Link to work:** No link so far.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
