# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018 (Linear Models in R - Tutorial 1)

**Today's Progress**: Traveling, so learning statistics tests in R. Today it was Linear Models.

**Thoughts:** Using Jupyter notebooks for R makes life easier. Though I have to learn how to plot better graphics.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018 (Mixed Linear Models in R - Tutorial 2)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Tutorial 2 for Mixed Linear Models. Started learning the concepts and did some coding. Have to finish it later.

**Thoughts**: The coding is quite straight forward. I feel that a course in R is going to be helpful.

### Day 3: January 5, Friday (Mixed Linear Models in R - Tutorial 2)

**Today's Progress**: Finished tutorial for mixed linear models.

**Thoughts** Some statistical knowledge is required to interpret the results of the code. That is something that I should invest soon.
