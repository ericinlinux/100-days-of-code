# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018 (Linear Models in R - Tutorial 1)

**Today's Progress**: Traveling, so learning statistics tests in R. Today it was Linear Models.

**Thoughts:** Using Jupyter notebooks for R makes life easier. Though I have to learn how to plot better graphics.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018 (Mixed Linear Models in R - Tutorial 2)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Tutorial 2 for Mixed Linear Models. Started learning the concepts and did some coding. Have to finish it later.

**Thoughts**: The coding is quite straight forward. I feel that a course in R is going to be helpful.

### Day 3: January 5, Friday (Mixed Linear Models in R - Tutorial 2)

**Today's Progress**: Finished tutorial for mixed linear models.

**Thoughts** Some statistical knowledge is required to interpret the results of the code. That is something that I should invest soon.

### Day 4: January 10, Wednesday (Python Coding - Sharing Behavior)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the parameter tuning algorithm and in the plotting of the results. Also worked in R for linear models.

**Thoughts** Have to double check the code later to see if everything is as expected. God many troubles using data frames in R, as I am not good on it.

### Day 5: January 11, Thursday (Python Coding - Health Behavior)

**Today's Progress**: Coding for data analysis in Python today. Functions for cleaning the data set and generating documentation for the project. 

**Thoughts** Finished the cleaning part of the code. Need to create a function to fetch the files generated.

### Day 6: January 12, Friday (Python Coding - Health Behavior)

**Today's Progress**: Coding for data analysis in Python today. Creating selection criteria for the nodes and building the notebooks for data analysis. 

**Thoughts** I took a long time to work on new code as I had to adjust the cleaning part of the code to return the data saved in the data folder. This was a requirement from Day 5. Testing notebook A for data selection.

### Day 7: January 16, Tuesday (NetLogo/Python - Obesity Project)

**Today's Progress**: Understanding some code in NetLogo and starting to create a code in Python to simulate spread of behavior in a network. 

**Thoughts** It took a long time to understand the code in NetLogo, as well as to decide how to get a csv file transfered into it. So now I have to generate the agents and connections to see if it is doable.

### Day 8: January 17, Wednesday (Python Coding - Obesity Project)

**Today's Progress**: Building the tables with the necessary information to initiate the agents and the connections. Connectios is done, and agents need some more work. 

**Thoughts** Reducing the amount of variables and controling the weights for each of them took a lot of concentration. I got the function to read the EI (Energy Intake). Tomorrow finish the PA function and test the network to see how is it. Also try to start the simulations.
